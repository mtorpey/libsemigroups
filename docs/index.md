Semigroups++

# Semigroups++ Version 0.0.1

This is the source code documentation for Semigroups++ produced using
[cldoc](https://github.com/jessevdk/cldoc). This documentation can be
compiled by running `make doc` in the `semigroupsplusplus`
directory, and the tests can be run by doing `make test` in the
`semigroupsplusplus` directory.

The algorithms and data structures in this version of Semigroups++ are
based on [Algorithms for computing finite semigroups](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Rio.pdf), 
[Expository Slides](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Exposes/StAndrews.pdf), and 
[Semigroupe 2.01](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html) 
by Jean-Eric Pin.

The Semigroups++ library is used in the [Semigroups package for GAP](http://gap-packages.github.io/Semigroups/).
The development version is available on 
[Github](http://https://github.com/james-d-mitchell/semigroupsplusplus).
