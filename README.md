# Semigroups++ - A C++ library for computing finite semigroups

## Introduction
Semigroups++ is a C/C++ library for computing finite semigroups; it is based on 
[Algorithms for computing finite semigroups](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Rio.pdf), 
[Expository Slides](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Exposes/StAndrews.pdf), and 
[Semigroupe 2.01](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html) by Jean-Eric Pin.

The Semigroups++ library is used in the [Semigroups package for GAP](https://gap-packages.github.io/Semigroups/).

The current version of Semigroups++ is 0.0.1 from ??.

## Documentation
The C/C++ library API is generated using [cldoc](https://github.com/jessevdk/cldoc) and available [here]().

## Dependencies

Semigroups++ requires a C++ compiler supporting the c++11 standard.
