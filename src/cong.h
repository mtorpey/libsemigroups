  //! This class represents a congruence on a semigroup defined either as an
  //! instance of a Semigroup object or as a finitely presented semigroup
  //! defined by generators and relations.
  //!
  //! The structure of a Congruence is determined by running several different
  //! methods concurrently until one method returns an answer. The number of
  //! different threads used can be controlled, in part, by the value passed to
  //! Congruence::set_max_threads. The use of multiple threads to find the
  //! structure of a Congruence can cause the return values of certain
  //! methods to differ for different instances of mathematically equal
  //! objects.
  //!
  //! This class and its implemented methods are somewhat rudimentary in
  //! the current version of libsemigroups.

    //! * \p type: a std::string describing the type of congruence, must be one
    //!   of \c "left", \c "right", or \c "twosided".
    //!
    //! * \p nrgens: the number of generators.

    //! congruence being constructed is defined. Every relation_t in this
    //! parameter must consist of positive integers less than \p nrgens.
    //!
    //! * \p extra: additional relations corresponding to the generating pairs
    //! of the congruence being constructed.  Every relation_t in this
    //! parameter must consist of positive integers less than \p nrgens.
    //!
    //! This constructor returns an instance of a Congruence object whose type
    //! is described by the string \p type. The congruence is defined over the

    //! and is the least congruence containing the generating pairs in \p extra.

    //! For example, to compute a congruence over the free semigroup the
    //! parameter \p relations should be empty, and the relations defining the
